Setup a cron job to run the release script.
node_release_script.sh, leasing.cfg and leasing files should be
in the same directory.

leasing file is the log file that script will update periodically. 
If you want to change the release time or give more time to some users you have to change this file. (threshold - "the last variable" is the remaining time.) by reducing threshold, you can give more time to the users.

**************************************
node_release_script.sh is the script to release nodes.

**************************************
leasing.cfg contains main configurations. 

you need to add names of the nodes which you want the script to take care of.

It also containes threshol variable. Based on cron job's iteration 
duration, threshold determines the release time. For a period of 6 hours, it is recommended to set the threshold to 36 and cron job to 10 minutes.
