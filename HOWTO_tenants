*************** NOTE *********************
Users of KUMO platform should know that in every 6 hours their nodes will be revoked by the system. 
If you need more time than 6 hours, you need to talk with the admin and ask him to give you more time.

If your node is revoked:
You are provided a reconnection script and a config file (connect_node.sh and reconnect.cfg). 
These two files can help you to re-acquire your previous nodes and reprovision them automatically. 

************* To get your node back and reprovisioned ************************

1- Check reconnect.cfg file to be sure if it contains the BMI ip address.
the format should be:

server BMI_IP_Address

(Chnage only BMI_IP_Address part.)

2- Put reconnect.cfg file in the same directory as connect_node.sh file.
3- run:
./connect_node.sh your_project_name your_node_name 

your_project_name is the project name you have created in HIL.
your_node_name should be dell-X which X is some number between 1 and 16. You should have this number from HIL.
