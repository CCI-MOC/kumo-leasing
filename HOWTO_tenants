Users of KUMO platform should know that in every 6 hours their nodes will be revoked by the system. 
If you need more time than 6 hours, you need to talk with the admin and ask him to give you more time.

You are provided a reconnection script and a config file (connect_node.sh and reconnect.cfg).
These two files can help you to reaquire your previous nodes and reprovision them automatically. 

run ./connect_node.sh your_project_name your_node_name. you should put the reconnect.cfg file in
the same directory as connect_node.sh. The config should contain BMI server's IP address.
